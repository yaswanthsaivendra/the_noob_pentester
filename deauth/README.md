# deauth
deauth is a tool to play with 802.11 wireless networks. We can use this tool to sniff for Access points, for stations connected to the access points, play a deauthentication attack on a target and we can also use this to host a fake access point. As we are going to capture packets in air(more precisely frames), all the reconssaince done with this tool come under passive reconassaince. yes, you guessed it right! we can do all this stuff only being in monitor mode. Creating a fake access point, playing a deauthentication attack can be used as a good starting point for exploitation phase and social engineering.

## Functionalities
* Enable monitor mode
* Passive Recon on 802.11 Frames
  * sniff for APs
  * collect information regarding APs include SSID, signal and encryption protocols
  * sniff for mac addresses of live stations
* Deauthentication attack
* Creating a Fake AP

usage: deauth.py [-h] [-c] [-a] [-s] [-M] [-t] [-A] [-m] [-k] interface

positional arguments:
  interface             interface to sniff for Aps,stations,to do deauthentication attack and to host a Fake AP

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c , --count          The number of deauthentication packets to send to the target station (or) victim computer
  -a , --bssid          Basic Service Set Identifier(BSSID) of the wireless access point(WAP)
  -s, --stations        To scan for mac adresses of stations connected to Access points.
  -M , --mac-address    Mac address for Fake Access point, if not mentioned a random mac is genrated by the program.
  -t , --target-mac     MAC address of the target station(victim's computer)
  -A , --access-point   Name(SSID) of the access point to create Fake AP
  -m, --monitor-mode    You can use this to enable monitor mode on the specified interface,to use this option make sure ifconfig and iwconfig tools are installed on your system. Mostly
                        they come by defualt on all major distributions.
  -k, --check-kill      You can use this option to kill the network manager and other network process on your system that may interrupt our work on being in Monitor mode. Doing this is
                        not mandatory but its always recommended for better results, to use this make sure airmon-ng(of aircrack-ng) is installed on our system, it comes by default with
                        all major pentration testing distributions.
