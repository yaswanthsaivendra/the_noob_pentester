# Scan TO Recon
scan to recon is a host scanning tool for open ports using different scan techniques.By analyzing the scan results we can get information of open, closed, filtered ports, presence of firewall, mac address of the NIC with which the scanned host connected to the network. Performing multiple scan techniques on single host will help us to identify the behaviour of the each host:port pair and presence of filtering for each port on a firewall if there is a one.

## Scan Techniques

* TCP SYN SCAN
* TCP CONNECT scan
* TCP SYN (Stealth) scan
* TCP ACK scan
* TCP XMAS scan
* TCP FIN scan
* TCP NULL scan
* TCP WINDOW scan
* UDP scan
* ARP scan
* ICMP PING sweep(on a network of hosts can be mentioned as CIDR notation)

Default tcp ports used in tcp scans: [20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 111, 115, 135, 139, 143, 161, 162, 194, 389, 443, 445, 992, 993, 995, 1723, 3306, 3389, 5900, 8080]
Default udp ports used in udp scans: [53, 67, 68, 69, 88, 161, 162, 389]
    
    
usage: scantorecon.py [-h] [-sT] [-sS] [-sA] [-sX] [-sF] [-sN] [-sW] [-sU] [-Arp] [-Pn] [-A] [-t {0,1,2,3,4}] [-p] [-pl] [-pr] [-o] host

positional arguments:
  host                  Target host to scan

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -sT, --conn-scan      Perform a TCP CONNECT scan
  -sS, --syn-scan       Perform a TCP SYN (Stealth) scan
  -sA, --ack-scan       Perform a TCP ACK scan
  -sX, --xmas-scan      Perform a TCP XMAS scan
  -sF, --fin-scan       Perform a TCP FIN scan
  -sN, --null-scan      Perform a TCP NULL scan
  -sW, --window-scan    Perform a TCP WINDOW scan
  -sU, --udp-scan       Perform a UDP scan
  -Arp, --arp-scan      Perform a ARP scan
  -Pn, --ping-sweep     Perform a ICMP PING sweep over a network of ip addresses. This option should be used alone without using any other scan technquies
                        and while using this the host should be replaced with CIDR notation of network. EX: 192.168.1.0/24
  -A, --agressive-scan  Perform a agressive scan. Enable all scan techniques with one single switch(ARP scan and PING sweep are excluded).
  -t {0,1,2,3,4}, --timeout {0,1,2,3,4}
                        Timeout between each request, by default it is set to 1 second.
  -p , --port           To scan a single port(by default only common ports will be scanned). EX: -p 22
  -pl , --ports         To scan list of ports seperated by commas(by default only common ports will be scanned). EX: -pl 22,23,43,8080
  -pr , --portrange     To scan a range of ports(by default only common ports will be scanned). EX: -pr 141-143
  -o , --outputfile     save the output to a file, Instead of displaying the ouput on terminal scan results will be saved into a file in current directory.
