# Scan TO Recon
scan to recon is a host scanning tool for open ports using different scan techniques.By analyzing the scan results we can get information of open, closed, filtered ports, presence of firewall, mac address of the NIC with which they are connected to the network. Performing multiple scan techniques on single host will help us to identify the behaviour of the each host:port pair and presence of filtering for each port in a firewall if there is a one.
