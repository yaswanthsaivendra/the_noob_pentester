#Arperr
Arperr is a cli tool using which we can use to arp a whole network of ip addresses(CIDR notated) to get their mac address and to do a arp poison attack on a target (or) victim and the tool has the buit-in functionality to send true arp packets to both the target and gateway at the stop of the attack so as to left no traces in the arp tables and minimize the detection of the attack by the victim.

## Functionalities
* Arp sweep over a network
* Arp poison (or) Arp spoofing attack
